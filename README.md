## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) +
[Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Development

### Local Development

1. Ensure that you have the [latest version of Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
1. If you do not have the Netlify CLI installed, follow the
   [Getting Started with Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) guide.
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `ntl dev`.

### Development in Gitpod

[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) is an online integrated development environment (IDE); TLDR an online
editor. Gitpod provides a VS Code-like experience in the browser.

To load the project, first fork this project to your own account, and then from the fork, e.g.
https://github.com/some-user/connect-four, you can load it in Gitpod by prepending the URL with
`https://gitpod.io/#`, e.g. `https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/some-user/connect-four`

It'll take a minute to load up.

Gitpod will prompt you to install the Svelte for VS Code extension. Click the Install button.

![Prompt asking to install the Svelte for VS Code extension](svelte-for-vs-code-extension.png)It
will install all npm packages for the project. Once all the dependencies are installed, it will load
the project by running `ntl dev` and the app will appear in development mode.

From there, you can start developing like you would if working on your local machine's IDE.
