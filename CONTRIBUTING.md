# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via an issue. Please use the issue templates. They are there to help you
and the maintainers gather information.

Before working on an issue, ask to be assigned to it. This makes it clear to
other potential contributors that someone is working on the issue.

When creating a PR, please fill out the template to the best of your abilities.
Maintainers are there to help you, so reach out via a comment in your PR.

Tests, formatting, and linting are run anytime you commit code in your working
environment, e.g. your computer or Gitpod. Linting and tests also run on builds.
If you have failing tests or linting issues and are unsure what to do, contact
maintainers via your PR or the issue you are working on.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md); follow it in all
your interactions with the project.

And lastly, remember to have fun!
